# KT2 TCR sequences
### Innate2Adaptive, May 2017

This repository contains FASTA files of the alpha and beta TCR sequences of the tetanus-toxoid T-cell line 'KT2'. These sequences were extracted using the Innate2Adaptive lab's ligation-mediated 5'RACE TCR amplification strategy, before being cloned into the pGEM T Easy vector and Sanger sequenced. These sequences can then be excised and included as controls in subsequent TCR amplification efforts.

The cells were originally a kind gift from Dr. Antonio Lanzavecchia; please refer to the original publication for details ([Demotz *et al.* 1984, JI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2463305)).
